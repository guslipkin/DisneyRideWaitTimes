## Section 1. Introduction
Introduction
The introduction should introduce your general research topic and your data (where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan
Explore the affects of weather conditions on wait times for popular Disney World rides.
- Does hot weather increase wait times for rides with a "Splash_Aspect"
- Does an rainy weather cause an increase in wait times for "indoor_rides"?

## Section 3. Data
Data Description
Print out a glimpse of the data frame. In your project repo: place your data in the /data folder, and add the data dictionary and source for the dataset to the README.md file in the /data folder. Make sure the codebook is neatly formatted and easy to read.
