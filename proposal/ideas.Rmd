## Section 1. Introduction
Introduction
The introduction should introduce your general research topic and your data (where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).
Our topic focuses on popular Walt Disney World attractions. In this data, we explore ride wait times 
and the affect that certain enviornmental conditions have on the duration of these wait times. We collected 
this data through researching Walt Disney World's data on wait times and ticket sales. Our data originated 
from the raw dataset: https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/crowd-calendar#DataSetsv
The cases for this data include___________________
The variables studied in this data include local schools in session, park capacity, holidays, weather conditions, 
as well as the opening and closing time of the park.


## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan
From the given datasets, we decided to create our own dataframe that focuses on data variables including weather, parade times, attraction wait times, splash aspect of ride, and whether the ride is indoor or outdoor.
Explore the affects of weather conditions on wait times for popular Disney World rides.
- Does hot weather increase wait times for rides with a "Splash_Aspect"
- Does rainy weather cause an increase in wait times for "indoor_rides"?
- Determine the busiest Day of week, Day of Month, Day of Year (lubridate data) for tourists to visit WDW
- Sunset time
- Create a structed travel plan for tourists to minimize the amount of time spent waiting in line

## Section 3. Data
Data Description
Print out a glimpse of the data frame. In your project repo: place your data in the /data folder, and add the data dictionary and source for the dataset to the README.md file in the /data folder. Make sure the codebook is neatly formatted and easy to read.
