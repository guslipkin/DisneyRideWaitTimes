The goal is to compare data between multiple dataframes so that only relevant data is used

Each ride has its own dataframe and is also part of a larger dataframe containing all rides

There is a metadata dataframe that has relevant data for each of the four parks

We want to create a new dataframe that has each ride as the row, the park its in, the ride opening data, if it has a splash aspect, and if it is indoors
